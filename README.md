* **Enterprise-Grade Security**: The platform incorporates robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and identity management, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

* **TypeScript**: The BlockchainProject is built using TypeScript, a statically typed, superset of JavaScript, providing robust type checking and improved code maintainability.
* **Node.js**: The platform utilizes Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, to enable fast, scalable, and efficient server-side execution.
* **Blockchain Framework**: The BlockchainProject leverages a custom blockchain framework, built on top of a popular blockchain protocol, to provide a scalable, secure, and decentralized infrastructure for data management and workflow automation.
* **Smart Contract Language**: The platform uses a smart contract language, such as Solidity, to develop and deploy secure, efficient, and automated smart contracts.

## Installation

To install the BlockchainProject, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/BlockchainProject.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the node: `npm run start`

## Configuration

The BlockchainProject requires the following environment variables to be set:

* `BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URL`: The URL of the blockchain node
* `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN_ID`: The ID of the blockchain chain
* `SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the smart contract

Additionally, the platform requires a configuration file (`config.json`) to be present in the project root, specifying the following settings:

* `dataDirectory`: The directory where data will be stored
* `analyticsEnabled`: A boolean flag indicating whether real-time data analytics are enabled

## Usage

To use the BlockchainProject, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the node: `node index.ts`
2. Create a new data record: `curl -X POST -H Content-Type: application/json -d '{key: value}' http://localhost:3000/data`
3. Retrieve a data record: `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/data/{id}`
4. Update a data record: `curl -X PATCH -H Content-Type: application/json -d '{key: new_value}' http://localhost:3000/data/{id}`
